            <p id="intro"><strong>Hi! I'm so happy that you're visiting my website. My name is Jillian Koenig and I'm 15 years old. 
                I was inspired to start baking when I was 12 years old after becoming obsessed with Food Network baking shows.
                As the years have gone by, I've improved my baking a lot and it's become one of my favorite hobbies (along with
                playing tennis, listening to Taylor Swift music, and binge-watching Parks & Rec and The Office)! I started my
                Instagram in 2018 because I wanted to be able to track my progress and share my Kreations (thanks to my
                sister for the username idea ;)! Over the past few years, I determined that my favorite things to bake 
                are cookie cakes and blondies/brownies. I also love decorating cakes. I'm going to be posting my favorite 
                recipes and tips & tricks on this page for anyone who loves to bake just as much as I do. I'll be updating
                the website often and I hope you find some inspiration here! (Also fun fact: I coded this entire website by 
                myself!)
